Thur 7/11 - Hours 3
Notes:
Weirdly difficult to set up
I2C connection wasnâ€™t working
Switched to SPI and it worked but the demo code stopped working at a point
Snowflakes are only on top bit and half of scroll is still on the screen
Future:
Learn to program it with actual words
Maybe switch to raspi to give it more functionality
Switch to Nano maybe

Mon 7/22 - Hours 4.5
Notes:
With JQ
Connected TOLED to Raspi
Worked, got clock, and scrolling to run

Future: 
Scrape Canvas
Find interfaces - buttons, touchscreens, dials
attach to glasses?
  Figure out where to display information
